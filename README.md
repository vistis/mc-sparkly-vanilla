Sparkly Vanilla is Minecraft modpack that aims to improve the vanilla experience without straying too far. The goal is to make Minecraft feel somewhat fresher, but still feel familiar and adhere to Minecraft's core philosophies.

The highlight feature is immersion. More ambiance, expressive animations, and more detailed terrains have been added to help the immerse the player into the world of Minecraft.

Sparkly Vanilla also features a new visual style, taking inspiration from Minecraft's promotional materials to make the game fresh yet familiar.

Even though for the most part, Sparkly Vanilla strictly keeps the vanilla feel, there are also some inclusion that changes the games significantly. These additions and changes are my own opinionated solution to address some real problems within Minecraft. Some of these include

- **Backpacks**: a band-aid solution to Minecraft's inventory problem
- **Better Mob AI**: bees are more intelligent at pathing. Villagers are smarter in addition to having more behaviors such as Armorers healing Iron Golems, and Clerics will heal other Villagers and players. Fish behaves in a more realistic way. Spiders are scarier
- **Rebalanced Enchantment System**: reduces the amount of grinding by adding more way to gain experience (from crops), leveling up pass level 30 will need the same amount of experience as leveling to level 30, and removing the "Too Expensive" limitation from anvils
- **Torch Buff**: torches are now even more useful, especially in the early games with torches now able to light mobs on fire on hit. Essentially an early game version of Fire Aspect
- **Soul Fire**: soul fire and flame are made to be more unique than just being normal fire but it's blue. Soul fire is more damaging now. In addition, soul versions of Flame and Fire Aspect have also been added
- **Keep Some Inventory**: tools and armors remain upon death. Makes it less frustrating when you die but doesn't mitigate death altogether like normal Keep Inventory. Items you drop on death will stay in place, preventing them from flying everywhere and potentially into lava. You can also get your levels back upon regaining your drops 

I've also added outvoted mobs from Mob Votes, as they were initially planned to part of the game at one points, they will fit right in current Minecraft.

There are also numerous quality of life improvement mods such as opening double doors in one click, protect your pets from friendly fire, give your pets another chance at life, snow under trees, better third person, and more.
